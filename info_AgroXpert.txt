üåæ AgroXpert: Smart Agriculture and Irrigation System using ESP32
AgroXpert is an intelligent, IoT-powered agriculture monitoring and automation system designed to revolutionize traditional farming with real-time data and precision control. Developed using the ESP32 microcontroller, AgroXpert integrates multiple environmental sensors, automated irrigation, and remote access features to empower farmers with actionable insights, water-saving efficiency, and smart crop management ‚Äî all accessible from a web dashboard or Telegram bot.

üîß Key Hardware Features
ESP32 Microcontroller
Acts as the brain of the system, offering Wi-Fi connectivity for remote control and data monitoring.

Soil Moisture Sensor
Continuously measures the water content in soil to determine if irrigation is needed.

DHT11/DHT22 Sensor
Monitors ambient temperature and humidity, essential for evaluating environmental conditions affecting crop health.

Water Pump with Relay Module
Automatically activated based on soil moisture levels. Farmers can also manually control it via a web interface or Telegram bot.

Water Level Sensor (Optional)
Detects the water tank level to avoid dry running of the pump or overflow.

OLED/LCD Display (Optional)
Displays real-time sensor data on-site for local viewing.

Power Source
Operates on rechargeable battery or solar power (optional), making it ideal for remote farms with limited grid access.

üåê Software & Connectivity Features
Web Dashboard (ESP32 Hosted)
A responsive HTML-based control panel hosted via ESP32‚Äôs access point or local Wi-Fi network. It displays:

Real-time sensor data

Pump status

Manual ON/OFF control buttons

System logs

Telegram Bot Interface
Provides remote access and control via Telegram with:

Live soil moisture, temperature, and humidity updates

Pump control buttons (Start/Stop)

Auto/manual irrigation toggle

Water tank level alerts (if sensor is connected)

Data Logging & Analytics (optional expansion)
Stores data in local memory or cloud (Google Sheets/Firebase) for historical trend analysis.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionalities
Automated Irrigation:
If soil moisture drops below a pre-set threshold, the ESP32 activates the water pump until ideal moisture levels are restored.

Remote Monitoring & Alerts:
Farmers receive sensor readings and irrigation alerts remotely via web or Telegram.

Manual Override & Safety:
Farmers can override the system and manually control the pump anytime. Water level safety prevents dry running.

Adaptability:
AgroXpert can be customized for various soil types, crop needs, and weather conditions.
